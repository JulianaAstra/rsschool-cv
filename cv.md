### Briefly About Myself:

I am a data markup specialist in Yandex. Previously, I was looking for myself in creativity, but for two years I have been studying programming in order to change direction. I have always been interested in computer science, so I decided to try myself in programming. Now I want to become a frontend developer and start a career in this field. I've graduated in JS developer (professional retraining courses) at Netology. I'm finishing studying in HTML Academy (JS Developer) at the moment. Among my strengths are the self-studying and searching for information, system thinking, and a creative approach to work.

      case SortType.TIME:
        return (
          findDifference(trip1["timeStart"], trip1["timeEnd"]) -
          findDifference(trip2["timeStart"], trip2["timeEnd"])
        );
      case SortType.PRICE:
        return trip2["price"] - trip1["price"];
      default:
        return (
          dayjs(trip1["timeStart"].valueOf()) -
          dayjs(trip2["timeStart"].valueOf())
